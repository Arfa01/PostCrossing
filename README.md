# PostCrossing

A PostCrossing database design ‚Äî where users send and receive postcards with people around the world.  
Each time a user sends a postcard, they become eligible to receive one from another random registered user.



## Overview

Integrated things in this project:
- RESTful API development using **Node.js** and **Express**
- **MongoDB** integration with **Mongoose**
- Realistic postcard-sending flow with automatic reciprocal postcards
- Auto-updated user statistics (sent, received, and country counts)
- Tested via **Thunder Client**



## Technology used

Backend : Node.js, Express 
Database :MongoDB (Mongoose ODM) 
Environment : dotenv 
API Testing : Thunder Client 
Browser Extension : Chrome (for tab sorting functionality) 



## Database models

### User
- `username`
- `email`
- `country`
- `address`
- Linked with `UserStats` and `Postcards`

### Postcard
- `postcardCode`
- `sender`
- `receiver`
- `message`
- `imageUrl`
- `status` ‚Üí travelling / received
- Automatically updates sender & receiver stats on receipt

### UserStats
- `totalSent`
- `totalReceived`
- `countriesSentTo`
- `countriesReceivedFrom`

### SendRequest
- Handles postcard sending requests, recipient FIFO assignment, expiry, and address snapshots

| GET | `/api/postcards/received/:userId` | View all postcards a user has received |
| PATCH | `/api/postcards/receive/:postcardId` | Mark a postcard as received & trigger a reciprocal postcard |

### Debug Routes
